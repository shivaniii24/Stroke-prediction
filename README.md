# Stroke-prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

This project describes step-by-step procedure for building a machine learning (ML) model for stroke prediction and for analysing which features are most useful for the prediction.

# About Dataset

The dataset contains 5110 real world observations and 10 different attributes:

1)gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"

2)age: age of the patient

3)hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

4)heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease

5)ever_married: "No" or "Yes"

6)Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"

7)avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood

8)bmi: body mass index

9)smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"

10)stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
