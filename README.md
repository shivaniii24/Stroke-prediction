# Stroke-prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

This project describes step-by-step procedure for building a machine learning (ML) model for stroke prediction and for analysing which features are most useful for the prediction.
